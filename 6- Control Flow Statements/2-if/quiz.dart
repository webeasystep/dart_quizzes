/* write if condition to test if the last has three values or four
if three print the last index 
if four clear all the elements

////////////
Define two integer variables called netSalary and expenses.

Then write a program that prints different sentences depending on these conditions:

if netSalary > expenses
    You have saved $(netSalary - expenses) this month
otherwise if expenses > netSalary
    You have lost $(expenses - netSalary) this month
otherwise
    Your balance hasn't changed
Then verify that the program works correctly for different values of netSalary and expenses.
